                <p>The Cosmere is a vast, interconnected fictional universe created by Brandon Sanderson, where many of his fantasy books take place. While each series or book can be read independently, they share a deeper underlying lore, with common themes, magic systems, and even recurring characters who travel between worlds.
                <br>
                Over time, connections between books become more apparent, rewarding readers who explore the entire universe.</p>
